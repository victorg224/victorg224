### Hey, I'm Victor 👋

Java Backend Engineer | Cloud-Focused Developer
Computer Science @ Saint Xavier University
Graduated December 2025 • Chicago, IL
I design and build scalable backend systems using Java + Spring Boot, deploy them in AWS environments, and focus on writing clean, production-ready code.
My goal: build reliable systems that are cloud-ready from day one.

### 🛠️ Projects

Application Tracker API
Java • Spring Boot • PostgreSQL • Spring Security • JWT • AWS (EC2, RDS)
Designed a layered architecture (Entity → Repository → Service → Controller) for clean separation of concerns
Implemented JWT-based authentication and role-secured endpoints using Spring Security
Integrated PostgreSQL locally and deployed with AWS RDS
Deployed backend to EC2 and managed environment configuration securely
Documented and tested APIs using Swagger and Postman

SXU Connect — React, Node.js, Express, AWS RDS (PostgreSQL)
Developed and tested REST APIs (Node.js/Express) for reviews and events, validating request/response handling and edge cases with Postman.
Executed SQL queries on AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) to verify data accuracy, relational integrity, and expected CRUD behavior.
Debugged API and data consistency issues using structured logging, reproducing defects and documenting resolutions.
Implemented authentication and role-based access control, creating test scenarios to validate authorization across endpoints.

Expense Tracker API
Spring Boot • PostgreSQL • AWS RDS • Swagger • JUnit
Built RESTful APIs supporting full CRUD operations
Implemented DTO-based request/response separation for clean API contracts
Developed analytics endpoints (total spend, category trends, highest/lowest category)
Connected application to a remote PostgreSQL instance hosted on AWS RDS
Configured secure environment-based database credentials
Documented and tested endpoints using Swagger and Postman

Full-Stack Expense Tracker
React • Express • PostgreSQL
Built RESTful APIs supporting full CRUD operations
Implemented DTO-based request/response handling for clean API contracts
Developed analytics endpoints (total spend, highest/lowest category, breakdown by type)
Structured service-layer logic for maintainable backend workflows
Configured secure database connections using environment variables
